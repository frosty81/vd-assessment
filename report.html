  Manipulating images is a critical skill for visual designers, as it allows them to create visually stunning compositions
  that convey the intended message effectively. Image manipulation involves altering and enhancing digital images to
  achieve a specific aesthetic or communicate an idea. In this short report, we will explore the fundamentals of
  manipulating images for visual design and discuss the various techniques used in the process.</p>

  <h2>The Basics of Image Manipulation</h2>

  <p>
Image manipulation involves making changes to a digital image using various software tools. A designer may alter an
image's colour, size, shape, texture, and contrast to achieve a desired effect. The process begins with selecting an
appropriate image that aligns with the design's purpose and message. Designers may use stock photos, illustrations, or
create original images.
  </p>

  <p>
nce an image is selected, the designer will use software tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or GIMP to
manipulate the image. The software allows the designer to apply various effects, filters, and transformations to the
image. For instance, a designer may adjust an image's brightness, contrast, and saturation levels to enhance its
colours. They may also apply blurring or sharpening effects to alter the image's texture and highlight specific elements
in the image.

  </p>

  <h2> Techniques Used in Image Manipulation</h2>

  <h2>
Colour Correction and Adjustment
  </h2>

  <p>
Colour correction and adjustment involve changing an image's colour balance, saturation, brightness, and contrast levels
to achieve a desired aesthetic. Designers use these techniques to ensure that the images they use in their design align
with the overall colour scheme and tone of the design. Colour correction is also used to correct the colours of an image
that has been poorly lit or taken with an incorrect white balance.
  </p>

  <h2> Cropping</h2>

  <p>
Cropping is a technique that involves removing unwanted portions of an image to focus on specific elements or create a
better composition. Designers use cropping to eliminate distractions, improve the overall balance of the image, or
create a better sense of depth.

  </p>

  <h2>Resizing and Scaling </h2>

  <p>
    Resizing and scaling involve changing an image's size to fit the design's requirements or create a specific visual
    effect. Designers may use resizing to reduce the file size of an image or create a thumbnail. Scaling, on the other
    hand, involves changing the image's size while maintaining its aspect ratio.

  </p>

 <h2>
Retouching and Restoration
 </h2>

  <p>
Retouching and restoration involve removing or adding elements to an image to create a more polished look. Designers use
retouching to remove blemishes, wrinkles, and other imperfections. Restoration, on the other hand, is used to repair
damaged or old images to restore their original quality.
  </p>

 <h2>
Masking and Layering
 </h2>

  <p>
Masking and layering are techniques used to create complex compositions by combining multiple images. Masking involves
hiding or revealing specific portions of an image to create a seamless blend with other images. Layering involves
stacking multiple images on top of each other to create a more dynamic composition.
  </p>

  <h2>
Conclusion
  </h2>

  <p>Manipulating images is an essential skill for visual designers. It allows designers to create compelling and visually
  stunning compositions that communicate a message effectively. The techniques discussed in this report are just a few
  examples of the various techniques used in image manipulation. Designers should continue to explore and experiment with
  different techniques to develop their skills and create unique and visually striking designs.
